        <h2>Welcome to SpaceTime</h2>

        <p>SpaceTime is an alternative entertainment platform that represent four of the core freedoms that defines humanity: Freedom of Information, Freedom of Opportunity, Freedom to Unite, and Freedom of Expression. We believe that everyone deserves to have a voice and that the world moves forward when we listen and build as a community. Our mission is to give everyone a voice and to show them, not only the world, but the universe because space is infinite.</p>
